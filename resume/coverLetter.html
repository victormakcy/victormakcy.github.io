				To Whom It May Concern,

				<br><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to have this opportunity to approach ________ as a hopeful part-time or full-time candidate for a Project Management or Development position. With my vast interest and experience with technology and software development, along with my desire to extend my knowledge through working with great and innovative new companies, I believe ______ is a company that I would love to work for.

				<br><br> I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo, in my fourth and final year, pursuing a Computer Science degree with a minor in Economics. My expected graduation date is April 2014. Throughout my academic career I have taken various computer science courses with interests in web programming and software development.

				<br><br> With these skills I have gained in my academia, I have worked for the Department of National Defense in Ottawa for two terms. The first term focusing on internal application development; responsible for creating, testing and implementing new features for internal tools that are used by various departments of the organization. My second term with the organization was with their development team where I implemented and maintained various features of the organization's internal website using the content management system called Drupal.

				<br><br> I then made my way to the private sector where I worked for a small startup in Toronto called Jugnoo Inc. for two terms. My first term's responsibilities were mainly front-end web development work, where I participated in the development of new core features for the main product of the company. For my second term, I was fortunate enough to be a part of the main back-end platform team that played as the backbone of the company's revamped product. I mainly dealt with back-end technologies and gained valuable experience and knowledge in back-end web application development.

				<br><br> I am currently wrapping up my final work term with a company in the Digital Media Zone called Hitsend Inc. and developing on their product SoapBox, an innovation management tool used by many companies.

				<br><br> As an independent developer, I have also taken strong interests in personal projects mainly focused on web development and web applications. I have created a simple web app called Tweet Finder that displays tweets which contain the keywords that are searched by the user. It is written with the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, Node.js) stack minus the MongoDB as a database was not required. Along with Tweet Finder I have created a simplistic memory game written in JavaScript, and am currently working on a Ruby on Rails application with the ability for users to upload images to the app. I am also a member of a blog called The Development which showcases and interviews designers and developers about their websites.

				<br><br> With my strong background in web development on both front-end and back-end I believe I am a great candidate for the project management role as I have the technical knowledge needed to effectively manage and build the product.

				<br><br> I continue to learn more about modern day web development as I delve deeper into new front-end web technologies and put heavy focus on ui/ux design aspects. With that said I believe that ________ would be the perfect place for me to not only grow as a developer, but also help design a quality product for the world. Thank you for your time and consideration on my application and I hope to hear from you soon.

				<br><br><br><br> Sincerely,

				<br><br> Victor Mak
